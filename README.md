# Identification-of-Additives-And-Preservatives-in-Packaged-Foods-using-Image-Processing
This is my final year main project
Overview of project:
1.Built a web application to raise public awareness about the potential 
health risks of additives & preservatives used in  processed foods. 
2.Enhanced the quality of user-uploaded image using image processing 
techniques, and then extracted text using CNN-based OCR model. 
3.Extracted data is cross-referenced with curated additives dataset and 
results are tabulated for user-friendly display.
